		<h4>Background on Information Technology:</h4>
		<p>
			&emsp;&emsp;I learned my first HTML and CSS when I was Grade 8. I studied some topics of networking like crimpping and making your own utp cable in Grade 9, 10, and 12, we also connect multiple computers. Learning about computer in my high school years help me improved my skills in networking.
		</p>

			&emsp;&emsp;Although it helps me improve my skills in networking, but when i started studying in college i found myself suited in programming or coding. Studying different languages to find what language suits me and plan to use that language in my career. The current programming language that I'm currently suited is C# and Java.
